# Computational Neuroscience Project

This project is to explore dataset vta-1 from crcns.org.

Information about the dataset can be found at: https://crcns.org/data-sets/bst/vta-1/about-vta-1

## Setting up

Follow instructions at [data/README.md] to download dataset.


Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies as follows:

``` shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, if you're using anaconda, create a new environment and run the following to install dependencies:

``` shell
conda install git numpy scipy pandas matplotlib notebook
```

Install the project in development mode by running `pip install -e .`. If you use notebooks, this will ensure that you can access your modules.
